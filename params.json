{"name":"Demo-sensors","tagline":"","body":"# Creative demo for mobile sensors\r\nLately I have worked on creative demos for mobile sensors. My goal was to make a demo, internet page, that would reach mobile sensors (from browser, of course) and then do something according to data received from the sensor.\r\n\r\nSince I come from a competitive programming background, the first step was learning some JavaScript and jQuery at Codeacademy. Knowing how to make a proper web site, I started doing research on what sensors smart phones and tablets have and whether web standards for accessing them exist. Most common sensors are accelerometer, gyroscope, geolocation sensor, camera, vibration and proximity sensor. Except for a camera, for all of them had been written web standards. You can find them at w3c. Thought web standards exist that does not mean mobile browsers support accessing mobile sensors. I found quite a useful chart on the internet. Based on gaining information, I decided to make a demo on accelerometer and gyroscope (motion sensors).\r\n\r\nWhen I finished the demo, I uploaded it on a server to test it on different devices. I had some difficulties finding browser that would support both features since I have an Android 2.3. It turned out Mozzila Firefox for Android did a better job than I did with the choice of effects. Orange square, that is supposed to blink when the device orientation changes and move when sensor detects acceleration , was blinking and moving constantly. Luckily, I figured that probably I should set the lowest angle difference and the lowest acceleration which trigger actions. In my case, the lowest angle difference is set on 2 degrees and the lowest acceleration of 1 meter per squared second.\r\n\r\nI tested the demo with Android Browser (only 3.0 or later can reach sensors),  Google Chrome for Android (motion sensor â€“ accelerometer is not supported),  Mozzila Firefox for Android and Safari (both support motion sensors). I could not test it on Windows Phone with Internet Explorer because non of my acquaintances own it.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
